<blockquote><p class=\"text-warning\"><em>We've made it a bit too easy for you to collect content that might actually have use restrictions.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class=\"text-warning\">In order to protect you we will have to change our tools so that you can't inadvertently (or intentionally) break the terms & conditions or copyrights held by these platforms and the content owned by users there.</p>
<p class=\"text-warning\">However, if you do in fact have the rights to the content you are collecting via FeedWax we can still help you.  Contact us at support@n0tice.com.  Thanks for your patience.</p><br>";
